# Apify Console

**Learn about Apify Console's easy account creation and user-friendly homepage for efficient web scraping management.**

## Sign-up

To use Apify Console, you first need to create an account. To create it please go to the [sign-up page](https://console.apify.com/sign-up). At the moment we support 3 different methods of creating an account:

### Email and password

This is the most common way of creating an account. You just need to provide your email address and a password. The password needs to be at least 8 characters, should not be your email address, and should either contain special characters or be long enough to be secure. The password field has a strength indicator below it that will tell you if your password is strong enough.

After you click the **Sign up** button, we will send you a verification email. The email contains a link that you need to click on or copy to your browser to proceed to automated email verification. After we verify your email, you will proceed to Apify Console.

#### CAPTCHA

We are using Google reCaptcha to prevent spam accounts. Usually, you will not see it, but if Google evaluates your browser as suspicious, they will ask you to solve a reCaptcha before we create your account and send you the verification email.

### Google or GitHub

If you do not want to create a new password for Apify Console, you can also use your Google or GitHub account to sign up. To do that, click the **Sign up with Google** or **Sign up with GitHub** buttons. You will proceed to the corresponding authentication page, where you must sign in and authorize Apify to access your account. Then, when you come back to Apify Console, we will create your account.

## Sign-in

To sign in to your account, please go to the [sign-in page](https://console.apify.com/sign-in). There, you can use any of the authentication methods you have set up for your account.

### Forgotten password

In case you forgot your password, you can click on the **Forgot your password?** link, which will redirect you to the [forgot password page](https://console.apify.com
