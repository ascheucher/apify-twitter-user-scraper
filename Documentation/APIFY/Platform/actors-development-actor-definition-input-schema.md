# Input schema

**Learn how to define and validate a schema for your Actor's input with code examples. Provide an autogenerated input UI for your Actor's users.**

The input schema defines the input parameters for an Actor. It's a `JSON` object comprising various field types supported by the Apify platform. Based on the input schema, the Apify platform automatically generates a user interface for the Actor. It also validates the input data passed to the Actor when it's executed through the API or the Apify Console UI.

The following is an example of an auto-generated UI for the [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor.

With an input schema defined as follows:

```json
{
    "title": "Input schema for Website Content Crawler",
    "description": "Enter the start URL(s) of the website(s) to crawl, configure other optional settings, and run the Actor to crawl the pages and extract their text content.",
    "type": "object",
    "schemaVersion": 1,
    "properties": {
        "startUrls": {
            "title": "Start URLs",
            "type": "array",
            "description": "One or more URLs of the pages where the crawler will start. Note that the Actor will additionally only crawl sub-pages of these URLs. For example, for the start URL `https://www.example.com/blog`, it will crawl pages like `https://example.com/blog/article-1`, but will skip `https://example.com/docs/something-else`.",
            "editor": "requestListSources",
            "prefill": [{ "url": "https://docs.apify.com/" }]
        },
        "crawlerType": {
            "sectionCaption": "Crawler settings",
            "title": "Crawler type",
