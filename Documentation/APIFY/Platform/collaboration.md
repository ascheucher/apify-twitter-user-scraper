# Collaboration

**Learn how to collaborate with other users and manage permissions for organizations or private resources such as Actors, Actor runs, and storages.**

By default, each system resource (Actor, key-value store, run, ...) you create is only available to you, the owner. You can grant access to your resources in three ways:

## 1. Access Rights

Enables you to grant access to another user for a certain resource you own. This allows you to:
- Share results with a client
- Enable engineers to collaborate on developing an Actor

## 2. Organization Account

Apify's organization account allows multiple engineers to collaborate on team projects with role-specific access permissions.

## 3. Publishing in Apify Store

Another way to share your Actor with other users is to publish it in [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store). When publishing your Actor, you can:
- Make it a Paid Actor
- Get paid by users benefiting from your tool

For more details, read the [publishing and monetization](/platform/actors/publishing) section.
