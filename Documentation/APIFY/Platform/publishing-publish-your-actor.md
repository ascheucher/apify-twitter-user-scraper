# Publish your Actor

**Prepare your Actor for Apify Store with a description and README file, and learn how to make your Actor available to the public.**

## Make your Actor public

Once you've finished coding and testing your Actor, follow these steps to publish it:

1. From your Actor's page in the Apify Console, go to **Publication** > **Display information**
2. Fill in all the relevant fields for your Actor (e.g., **Icon**, **Actor name**, **Description**, **Categories**)
3. Save your changes

After filling in all required fields, the **Publish to Store** button will turn green. Click on it to make your Actor available to the public on the Apify Store.

### Logo

It's strongly recommended to add a unique image that visually represents the service your Actor provides. This helps users quickly understand its purpose. **Important**: Do not use official logos or branded images from the sites you're scraping to avoid copyright issues.

### Description

The Actor's description is a short paragraph explaining its purpose, displayed on the Actor's page below its title.

When writing the description, you can also provide an SEO title & description. Effective SEO titles & descriptions should:

- Utilize popular keywords related to the Actor's functionality
- Summarize the Actor's purpose concisely
- Be between 40 to 50 characters for the title
- Be between 140 to 156 characters for the description

### README

Include a comprehensive README detailing:
- Actor features
- Reasons for scraping the target website
- Instructions on how to use the Actor effectively

Tips for creating the README:
- Use the provided template as a starting point
- Adapt the complexity to match your Actor's specific requirements
- Apply SEO principles to optimize for search engines
