# Development: Quick Start

**Create your first Actor using the Apify Console IDE or locally.**

> Note: Before you start building your own Actor, try out a couple of existing Actors from Apify Store.

## Language

Any code that can run inside a Docker container can be turned into an Apify Actor. This provides flexibility in choosing:
- Technical stack
- Programming language
- Technologies

Recommended languages:
- JavaScript/Node.js
- Python

These languages offer:
- SDK support
- API clients
- Learning materials
- Code templates

## Local Development

You can create an Actor in two ways:

1. **Web IDE** in Apify Console
   - Fastest way to start Actor development
   - Quick platform exploration

2. **Local Development**
   - Develop locally
   - Use local setup for better development
   - Deploy to Apify platform when production-ready

### Getting Started Options

- [Apify Console web IDE](/platform/actors/development/quick-start/web-ide)
- [Locally on your machine](/platform/actors/development/quick-start/locally)

The documentation provides navigation to choose between web-based and local Actor development approaches.
