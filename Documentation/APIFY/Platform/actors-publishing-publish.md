# Publish your Actor

**Prepare your Actor for Apify Store with a description and README file, and learn how to make your Actor available to the public.**

## Make your Actor public

Once you've finished coding and testing your Actor, it's time to publish it. Follow these steps:

1. From your Actor's page in the Apify Console, go to **Publication** > **Display information**
2. Fill in all the relevant fields for your Actor (e.g., **Icon**, **Actor name**, **Description**, **Categories**)
3. Save your changes

After filling in all the required fields, the **Publish to Store** button will turn green. Click on it to make your Actor available to the public on the Apify Store.

To verify that your Actor has been published successfully, go to the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store), search for your Actor's name. Click on your Actor's card to view its dedicated page.

### Logo

We strongly recommend adding a unique image to your Actor that visually represents the service it provides. This helps users quickly understand its purpose. However, do not use official logos or branded images from the sites you're scraping, as this can lead to copyright or trademark issues.

### Description

The Actor's description is a short paragraph that explains its purpose. It will be displayed on the Actor's page, right below its title.

When writing your Actor's description, you also have the option to provide an SEO title & description. These will be used in search engine result pages instead of Actor's name & description. Effective SEO titles & descriptions should:

- Utilize popular keywords related to your Actor's functionality
- Summarize the Actor's purpose concisely
- Be between _40_ to _50_ characters for the title and _140_ to _156_ characters for description

### README

The next step is to include a comprehensive **README** detailing your Actor's features, reasons for scraping the target website, and instructions on how to use the Actor effectively.

Remember that the Actor's README is generated from your `README.md` file, and you can apply the same [SEO principles](https://apify.notion.site/SEO-990259fe88a84fd0a85ce6
